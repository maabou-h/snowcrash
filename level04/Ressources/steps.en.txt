# by going to [vm ip]:4747 we can see that a page is running
# we deduct that use CGI qw{param} gets a parameter from url
# and that it uses the param named x if present in the subroutine x
# so we name a param x with a random value and see that it outputs
# the value in the webpage
# we see that it actually prints the result of echo with the value of the param x to the echo
# so we could make it echo the result of a command by prefixing and suffixing the value of x with backquotes
# so lets use /?x="`/bin/getflag`" since the perl script runs as flag04 as seen below
< level04@SnowCrash:~$ ls -la level04.pl
> -rwsr-sr-x 1 flag04 level04 152 Mar  5  2016 level04.pl
# so after going to http://192.168.1.83:4747/?x="`/bin/getflag`"
# the webpage outputs:
> Check flag.Here is your token : ne2searoevaevoem4ov4ar8ap
